# ECE100Manuals
LaTeX Files for generation of Lab Manuals in ECE100 Course

#Modifying Lab Documents
All Prelab and Postlab document files are stored in the TeX\_files directory. These files are each imported into the main document in main.tex. To update changes to the main document, open main.tex and recompile (twice) to ensure the Table of Contents is updated accordingly

#My Environment
These LaTeX Documents were compiled using TexStudio on Ubuntu 20.04, with the texlive-full package installed. Some editing of parameters is needed to get mintedworking in TeXstudio
